# TilemapCompiler

A lightweight tilemap creation utility built in Godot 4.4.

## Status

Work in progress.
TilemapCompiler is an unfinished helper application intended to simplify tilemap creation and iteration.

# Overview

TilemapCompiler is a small Godot 4.4 application that allows users to select image files and arrange them into a tilemap. It is designed to make updating and reloading tile assets quick and convenient during development.

While originally created to assist the TilesetViewer project, it can be used for general tilemap creation in other workflows as well.

# Key Functionality

Refresh the tilemap to reflect updated image files

Restore the previous session when reopening the application

Export the tilemap as a PNG file
